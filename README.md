# Online Visualizer

## How to

First, in Chrome you have to enable this:  
[chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost](chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost)

Then, you can go to:  
https://nicoschmitt.github.io/pogo.webui/

Tips, you can add the url to connect to directly (if you have multiple bots):  
https://nicoschmitt.github.io/pogo.webui/?websocket=ws://localhost:14252

The port to put it here is port port you define in Necrobot config + 1 (14251 by default gives 14252 here).
